 * Test Physics class with unit tests

/* Instructions from the assignment 
Each unit test should have four parts: Setup, Exercise, Verify, and Teardown. 
Note that a unit test for a function only needs two parts: Exercise and Verify.
Most functions will need at least 2 or 3 unit tests to get sufficient coverage, 
and most classes need to have every non-trivial method tested. 
This means that a few dozen unit tests will need to be created.
